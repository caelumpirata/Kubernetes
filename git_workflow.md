# Basice Git Workflow


## [initial setup](#1--git-clone-your-repo-to-your-local-machine)
## [Best practice after your `Initial Setup` is done](#for-those-who-have-already-setup-their-local-env)

### 1. Git clone your repo to your local machine.

   ```
    git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repo_name>.git
   ```

### 2. Enter your repo directory

  ```
  cd repo_name
  ```
currently you are in `main` branch

### 3. Create a new branch to work with

  Basically `main` branch codes are used in production, that's why we will create new branch to do changes from our side.
   
   this will clone all your content of your `main` branch to `new` branch.
   
    
    git branch new_branch_name

    git checkout new_branch_name
    


### 4 . Update  image `tag` name in `.gitlab-ci.yml` file
  ```
  nano .gitlab-ci.yml
  ```
change the tag name as today's date or whatever name you want to give.

eg. `caelumpirata/my_image:march_30`

  ```
image: docker:20.10.16
services:
  - docker:20.10.8-dind


variables:
    DOCKER_HOST: tcp://docker:2375
    DOCKER_DRIVER: overlay
    APP_IMAGE: <USERNAME/IMAGE_NAME>:<TAG> 

  ```

save the changes using  `ctrl + x` and then press `y` to save, then press  `enter`.

### 5 . Put your updated files which you want to upload in this directory (just copy and paste).

  âš  don't copy `.git`, `node-modules` and `taget' directory if you are using `Java project with Maven`  

### 6. After your files are copied, then run these commands
   ```
   git add .
   ```
   ```
   git commit -m "enter your desired comment for future reference"
   ```
   ```
   git push origin branch_name
   ```


âœ… next time, you can use this same branch 

just  `copy and paste the code` and  `git add .` and make some comment and push it to git.

ðŸ“Œ Don't forget to update [.gitlab-ci.yml](#4--update--image-tag-name-in-gitlab-ciyml-file) file everytime you push `to create new image'

or create a new one as per your need.

-----------------------
## For those who have already setup their local env

>> make sure to run command `git pull origin main` before you make changes in local and push your local changes to git.
>> 
>> why??
>> 
>> answer is to make your local code match with the `main` branch in the git,
>>
>>  your another colleagues might have made some changes while working in same project while you were away !
>> 
>>  and this is mandatory step for smooth workflow
